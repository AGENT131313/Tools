Problem: Dependency conflicts and situations where dependencies in the kali repo 
         overwrite system packages

Proposed solution: When installing packages from local .deb files on the hard disk
                   all dependencies are taken from existing repositories which 
                   shouldn't break anyones system. However dependencies which
                   reside only in the kali repos shall be downloaded and installed
                   first.
                   So the new program downloads the .deb files directly from the
                   repo-servers and installs them locally.

-----

1) Download the .deb version of a package via `apt-get download`
2) Check all dependencies which reside only in a kali-repo
3) Download those too as .deb files
4) Install everything
